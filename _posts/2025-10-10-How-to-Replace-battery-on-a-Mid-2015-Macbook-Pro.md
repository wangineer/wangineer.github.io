# How to Replace a battery on a Mid 2015 Macbook Pro

## Scenario:
Two years ago, my dad passed away. Among the many things he left behind were boxes of external drives, cords, and his old MacBook Pro (Mid-2015) — a machine full of memories, photos, and projects.

When I first opened his laptop, I noticed something wasn’t right: the bottom case wouldn’t fully close. After some inspection, I realized the battery had swollen, a common issue with aging MacBook models. Out of concern for safety — and maybe a bit of hesitation — I decided to set it aside until I felt ready to fix it properly.


## The Waiting Game
For over two years, that MacBook sat untouched. Every time I looked at it, I thought about my dad’s work and the things he created on it. I wanted to bring it back to life, but I also wanted to do it right.

I knew replacing a MacBook battery wasn’t as simple as swapping out RAM like I’d done many times before. This process came with real risks — puncturing a swollen battery could release toxic fumes or even start a fire, completely destroying the laptop.

## Gathering the Right Tools
Replacing the battery in a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid-2015) isn’t particularly difficult, but it does require patience and the correct tools. Here’s what I used:

* Replacement Battery: [**MacBook Pro 15" Retina (Mid-2015) Battery**](https://a.co/d/dhHWfZD){:target="_blank"} on Amazon

* Precision Screwdriver Set: [**Small Precision Screwdriver Kit**](https://a.co/d/6XI1MLe){:target="_blank"} on Amazon

* Rubbing Alcohol: Helps loosen the adhesive under the old battery cells safely.

> The battery itself has the proper screws and scraper needed to complete the job, but I wanted to buy a more robust tool set.  I also found the "Opener" tool provided the correct scraper to take the adhesive off.

## Safety First

> Swollen batteries can be dangerous. If your laptop’s bottom case bulges or won’t close, don’t keep charging or using it. Lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if punctured, overheated, or compressed.

Place the laptop on a flat, non-flammable surface and unplug it completely. If it looks severely swollen, you may want to consult a professional repair shop before continuing.

Here’s a quick overview of what the replacement involved:

1. Power down and disconnect everything.
2. Remove the bottom cover using the correct Pentalobe screwdriver.
3. Disconnect the old battery cable carefully.
> After disconnecting the battery make sure you press the power button for 30 seconds to drain all the reamining juice

4. Loosen the adhesive holding the old battery
> This is the most dangerous part, make sure you are in a ventilated area as if you start smelling some sweet smells, its the battery electrolytes leaking out and are very toxic to breathe in.

5. Gently pry out each battery cell — one at a time.

6. Once the battery is completely you, you will need to clean up all of the old sticky substance.  This is where the rubbing alcohol comes in to play

7. Once all clean, it should look something like the below. I probably could have spent more time near the trackpad.

8. Position the new battery and reconnect it.
9. Replace the bottom cover and tighten the screws evenly.
10. Calibrate the battery by charging it fully and letting it drain once. (See youtube for proper steps)

## A Moment of Reflection

Once the new battery was installed and I powered up the MacBook, the familiar chime echoed through the room. It wasn’t just a machine turning on — it felt like I was bringing back a small piece of my dad’s presence.

In a way, fixing the battery became symbolic: it was about restoring something that had been left dormant for too long, both physically and emotionally.


## Final Thoughts

If you have a MacBook Pro from 2015 with a swollen battery, don’t panic — but don’t ignore it either. With the right tools, a steady hand, and patience, you can safely bring it back to life.

For me, this wasn’t just about a repair. It was about reconnecting with my dad’s world — one screw at a time.
