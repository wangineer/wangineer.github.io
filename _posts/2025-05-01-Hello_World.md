## Hello World!

Welcome to my new website! 

## Who am I

I am a husband and father.

## How do I make a living

With over 14 years of experience in the tech industry and a prior background in food manufacturing, I’ve had the opportunity to work across diverse industries and roles, gaining a broad range of expertise. My career journey has taken me from live television broadcast operations to supporting a high-performing school district, and now contributing to a Fortune 500 company.

I’ve held positions such as Technician, Network Systems Analyst, and Network Engineer, but my skills extend far beyond networking. I’ve supported various facets of the organizations I’ve worked for, leveraging my adaptability and problem-solving abilities to make meaningful contributions wherever needed.

This unique blend of experiences has shaped my approach to technology and teamwork, and I’m passionate about continuous learning and applying my knowledge to create impactful solutions.

## Hobbies
Outside of work, I’m a tech enthusiast who loves exploring new gadgets, tools, and trends. I’m also a fan of grilling and barbecuing, where I get to combine creativity and precision to craft the perfect meal.

In my earlier years, I enjoyed playing guitar, and while I don’t play as often these days, music remains a big part of my life. These hobbies remind me to stay curious, creative, and balanced in everything I do.

## Tech Projects
I’m passionate about exploring new technologies and finding creative ways to integrate them into my home. Whether it’s automating my garage door, monitoring power levels on critical circuits to protect my freezer full of food from power loss, or experimenting with smart home setups, I enjoy turning everyday challenges into innovative solutions.

One of my favorite tools is Home Assistant, which I use to build and customize automations that make my home smarter and more efficient. My home lab is another area where I get to experiment—it’s equipped with network gear and a server, giving me the perfect environment to test, learn, and grow my technical skills.

Currently, I’m diving into Git to improve my version control skills and plan to explore and Docker next to expand my knowledge of containerization and modern development workflows. For me, technology isn’t just a career—it’s a hobby and a constant source of inspiration.

## Philanthropy
Giving back is an important part of who I am. I’m proud to serve as a board member for JustHelpOne.com, an organization dedicated to supporting individuals and families who have experienced loss through natural disasters.

We focus on helping those who have lost more than just their homes and personal belongings, providing them with resources and support to rebuild their lives. This work has been deeply rewarding and aligns with my belief in making a positive impact wherever possible.
