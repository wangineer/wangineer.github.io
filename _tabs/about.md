## Hello World!

Welcome to my site, I'm glad you're here. 

## Who am I

I’m Kevin, a husband, father, and network systems engineer with over 14 years of experience. This blog is where I document what I’m learning about automation — from Git and Python to Docker and homelabs — and share it with others in the networking community. Think of this as a learn-in-public notebook where wins, mistakes, and aha moments all have a place.

## My Career Journey

With more than **14 years of experience** in the tech industry (and an earlier career in food manufacturing), I've had the opportunity to work across diverse industries and roles. My path has taken e from **live television broadcast operations**, to **supporting a high-performing school district**, to my current role contributing at an **aspiring Fortune 500 company** as a Network engineer. 

Along the way, I've held positions such as **Technician, Network Systems Analyst, and Network Engineer** deveolping expertise in:

* Networking (Cisco, Palo Alto, SD-WAN / Viptela, HP, Ubiquiti, pfsense, AWS/Azure/OCI Hyperscalers)
* Virtualization (Windows Hypervisor, VMware)
* Server & Datacenter Management
* Load Balancing (AVI, F5, HA Proxy)
* Identity & Access (GSuite, Active Directory, MDM, Content Filtering)

This blend of experience taught me to be adaptable, collaborative, and relentlessly curious.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm **building my skills in automation and modern infrastructure**.  The industry has been changing and I am starting to dive into Git, Python, Docker, and Cisco pyATS.  My goal is to bridge traditional networking with automation, helping teams scale faster, reduce errors, and free up engineers to focus on innovation.

I document what I'm learning on this blog, so others can follow along and (hopefully) benefit from my journey.

## Beyond Work

Outside the office, you'll find me:

* Experimenting in my **homelab** with Home Assistant, smart home projects, and network gear
* **Grilling and barbecuing** (because tuning fire and smoke isn't so different from tuning configs)
* Staying creative through **music and guitar**
* Exploring new podcasts, books, and tools to keep my curiousity sharp

## Giving Back

I also serve as a **board member for JustHelpOne.com**, a nonprofit supporting individuals and families who have experienced devastating loss through natural disasters. Helping others rebuild aligns with my belief that technology and community should both serve a greater purpose. 

## Lets Connect

Whether you're here to learn, collaborate, or just explore, I'd love to connect. I try to regularly share updates about **networking, automation, and homelab experiments** on this blog and on LinkedIN. 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to exchange ideas, share resources, or chat about technology, careers, or even BBQ tips. 

Thanks for visiting, I'm looking forward to the journey ahead.
